I write code for an educational company in San Antonio Texas where I get to work with the following frameworks and technologies: 

  * Ruby on Rails
  * Backbone.js
  * CoffeeScript
  * TDD

For the past year I've been employed as an apprentice. It's been a pretty fantastic learning experience. 

For this blog I will attempt to log at least one thing I have learned each day for reference later.
