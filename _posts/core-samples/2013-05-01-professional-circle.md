### The importance of networking

Even in a field like programming, or any other engineering discipline where soft skills aren't necessarily a make or break metric of job performance, networking is invaluable. 

I see two major benefits to cultivating a talented circle of friends and a colleagues. 

1. 	Ambition is contageous. When someone is excited about what they do, they tend to motivate the people around them. This is a pretty powerful concept. If you are lucky enough to work with someone who loves their job, you're probably benefiting from that in ways you don't fully grasp. 

2. 	Surrounding yourself with talented people who are good at what they do and enjoy doing it opens future collaboration opportunities that otherwise wouldn't have been possible.

I have been trying to learn more the of these 'soft skills' lately. It is important, even in a technical field like software.
