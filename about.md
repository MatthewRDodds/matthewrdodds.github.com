There is something incredibly fascinating about the idea of translating a concept into reality, making the unseen visible. That is the job of software developers. They make things.

I'm Matthew Dodds, and I have the privilege of working [as a Ruby on Rails Developer](http://20spokes.com)]. I get to learn about technology everyday and enhance my skills as a technologist and as a software craftsman.

Check out some code at [Github](https://github.com/MatthewRDodds), or visit my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/doddsmatthew) profile. When I'm not working I can be found sharing cool things I find on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dodds_M) or cool things I see on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mdodds2).
